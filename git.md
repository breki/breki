- `git branch`: displays a list of checked out branches and which is the active branch
- `git checkout -b <branch>`: creates a new branch and switches to it
- `git checkout <branch>`: switches to a different branch
- `git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>`: resets the branch, undoing all local changes. The `--hard` option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in `origin/branch`
