## Smoothing of paths
Found [Script for Simplifying Paths](http://kelsocartography.com/blog/?p=2205), downloadable from [GitHub](https://github.com/nvkelso/jim-heck-pinball-scripts). Place all .jsx files into the `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2018\Presets\en_US\Scripts` directory (note this will change with new versions of Illustrator and I don't know if it automatically copies user scripts to a new location). 

Restart Illustrator, now you can find the scripts under the `File` | `Scripts` menu item. I tried `RemoveRedundantPoints.V1.8` and it seems to be working.


# Scripting

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes when a new Illustrator version arrives, it doesn't properly update the scripting API and you get errors like

    System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast COM object of type 'System.__ComObject' 
    to interface type 'Illustrator.Application'. 
    This operation failed because the QueryInterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID
    '{95CD20AA-AD72-11D3-B086-0010A4F5C335}' failed due to the following error: 
    No such interface supported (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80004002 (E_NOINTERFACE)).
    
In this case, uninstall all versions of Illustrator, install the latest one, re-add Illustrator reference in the C# project, rebuild and try again.
