### Remote Access From Windows
* [X2Go](http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:newtox2go) - doesn't seem to work for my Ubuntu Unity 16.04.2 - the session screen is black
* [Can I access Ubuntu from Windows remotely?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/592537/can-i-access-ubuntu-from-windows-remotely) - basically says you need to switch to xfce4, since Unity is not supported (I tried it on a Ubuntu 16.04.2 Unity VM and it doesn't really work, so it must be true)
* [How to Remote Access to Ubuntu 16.04 from Windows](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/07/remote-access-ubuntu-16-04/) - explains how to do it via VNC protocol
